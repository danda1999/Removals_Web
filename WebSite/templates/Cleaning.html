            <h2 class=" text-center text-warning">Why Keep Your Carpets and Upholstery Clean</h2><br>
          
            <p class="text-center text-primary" style="font-size: 23px;">Carpets are a high traffic area in any workplace with staff and clients regularly walking back and forth on them. 
                The fibres absorb dirt and germs but when the fibres start to clump together, they can’t do their job properly and pollutants and allergens rise into the air. 
                A buildup of bacteria can also be to the detriment of the carpet, making it more vulnerable to wear and tear.<br>
                Keeping your carpets clean is vital to maintaining the health of your workers or your family members. 
                A clean carpet ensures your staff or family members aren’t picking up or transmitting as many germs and it also protects your clients or visitors. 
                It can be beneficial to the overall appearance of your workplace/home as well. A clean carpet can look fluffed up and well-cared for if it has long, thick fibres or professional and smart if you have a shorter cut. 
                This enhances your image, allowing you to present yourself as respectable and reliable to potential clients or your home visitors.<br>
                The same goes for any upholstery or furniture your workplace/home may have. 
                Germs can live on the soft fibres so keeping them clean protects you and your clients when you sit down to work or have a meeting and ensures that you’re making sure every last aspect of your workplace/home is in top condition.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-center text-warning">How to keep your carpets clean</h2><br>

            <p class="text-center text-primary" style="font-size: 23px;">
                There are many different ways to keep a carpet clean such as using special shampoos to clean out germs and separate fibres that have clumped together. 
                Some shampoos come in special hoovers that allow you to shampoo and vacuum simultaneously.<br>
                Regular vacuuming is a good way to keep on top of any dirt that can accumulate over the course of a day and make sure your workplace is always looking its best. 
                There is also a dry cleaning process that can mean you don’t have to wait for the carpet to dry after cleaning if you need a quicker solution.<br>
                There are also different shampoos and carpet foams you can use to clean up any stains and catch spillages as quickly as possible. 
                Carpet foams are designed to lift spilled fluid and dirt off carpets in a few minutes to prevent staining.

            <h2 class="text-center text-warning">Quality Controls</h2><br>

            <p class="text-center text-primary" style="font-size: 23px;">
                Cleaning can also bring colour back into fading fibres and help your carpet look fresh and new again, supporting the professional image of your company or your home.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-center text-warning">Eco-friendly Products</h2><br>

                Chemicals can be to your company’s detriment, causing allergic reactions and affecting the mental health of your staff or family members.<br>
